# Cloister

This was composed in Sonic Pi using temperature, SpO2, and PRbpm numbers that I tracked when I had COVID and was shut into a hotel room for a week in Chicago. I used my gate number from when I flew in and out of O'Hare on that trip as the randomization seed. Other weird numerological stuff in there, too.
